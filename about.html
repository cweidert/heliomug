        I grew up in the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Washington#Climate">shrub-steppe
        landscape</a> of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-Cities,_Washington">south-eastern
        Washington State</a>.  My father is an engineer who helps clean up the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site">Hanford Site</a>
        and my mother is a public health nurse who educates people about their
        impending and newly born babies.  I've also got a brother who teaches
        math in the Portland area.  When we were little, we spent a lot of time
        running around with our cousins on the farm where my mom grew up.  My
        family is the best.  
        </p>

        I have always enjoyed math and science.  The highlight of my
        pre-college days is probably participating in the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Bowl">National Science
        Bowl</a> with some of my high school friends.  I was also a pretty avid
        soccer player for a number of years.  After high school, I studied math
        and computer science at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd
        College</a>, a small tech school east of Los Angeles.  Following that,
        I moved to Vancouver for a couple of years to attend <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a> and double down on the computer science degrees.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In 2010, I joined the <a href="http://www.mfala.org/">Math for America,
        Los Angeles</a> program, which is designed to help build and support
        math teachers in the greater Los Angeles area.  I taught geometry,
        statistics, and computer science in the Los Angeles Unified School
        District for five years.  I have a lot of feelings about it, but it was
        mostly pretty good.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In 2016, I married <a href="./images/photos/tennis.gif">my wonderful
        wife</a>.  I retired from teaching that June and now engineer software
        for Google over in Venice Beach.  I'm on a team that creates tools to
        determine how effective advertisers' ad campaigns are.  That way,
        advertisers will give Google the maximum amount of dollars so we can
        keep making the coolest stuff.
