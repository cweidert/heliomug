        I grew up in the shrub-steppe landscape of south-eastern Washington State.  
        My father works as an engineer helping to clean up the <a href="http://www.hanford.gov/">Hanford Site</a>, which was originally established to manufacture plutonium for use in the Manhattan Project.  
        My mother is a nurse and comes from farming family.  
        When I was little, I spent a lot of time running around with my cousins on the farm.  
        My brother is a teacher in the greater Portland area.  
        My family is the best.  
        </p>

        I have always enjoyed math and science.  
        The highlight of my pre-college days is probably participating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Bowl">National Science Bowl</a> with some of my high school friends.  
        I was also a pretty avid soccer player for a number of years.  
        After High School, studied math and computer science at Harvey Mudd College, a small tech school on the eastern outskirts of Los Angeles County.  
        Following that, I lived in Vancouver, Canada for two years while earning a master's degree in computer science from Simon Fraser University.  
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2010, I joined the <a href="http://www.mfala.org/">Math for America, Los Angeles</a> program, which is a program designed to help math teachers in the greater Los Angeles area.  
        I taught geometry, statistics, and computer science in the Los Angeles Unified School District for five years.  
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2016, my wonderful wife and I got married at a wonderful ceremony surrounded by friends and family in San Pedro, California.  
        In June, I retired from teaching and studied up to become a software engineer.  
        I expect to start working for Google in early 2017.
