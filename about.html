        I grew up in the shrub-steppe landscape of south-eastern Washington State.  
        My father is an engineer who helps clean up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site">Hanford Site</a> and my mother is a public health nurse who helps people with their impending and newly born babies.  
        My brother is a math teacher in the greater Portland area.  
        When we were little, we spent a lot of time running around with our cousins on the farm where my mom grew up.  
        My family is the best.  
        </p>

        I have always enjoyed math and science.  
        The highlight of my pre-college days is probably participating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Bowl">National Science Bowl</a> with some of my high school friends.  
        I was also a pretty avid soccer player for a number of years.  
        After high school, I studied math and computer science at Harvey Mudd College, a small tech school east of Los Angeles.  
        Following that, I lived in Vancouver, Canada for two years while earning a master's degree in computer science from Simon Fraser University.  
        </p>

        In 2010, I joined the <a href="http://www.mfala.org/">Math for America, Los Angeles</a> program, which is designed to help build and support math teachers in the greater Los Angeles area.  
        I taught geometry, statistics, and computer science in the Los Angeles Unified School District for five years.  
        </p>

        In 2016, I married <a href="./images/photos/tennis.gif">my wonderful wife</a> down in San Pedro, California.  
        That June, I retired from teaching and studied up to become a software engineer.  
        In early 2017, I'm going to start working for Google.
