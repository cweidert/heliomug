      <section title="Machine Learning" id="secMachine">
        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>I haven't done anything too crazy with machine learning outside of taking a couple of classes, but it's very interesting to me.  I talk a little more about it <a href="./prog/ml/">here</a>.</p>
      </section>

      <section title="Websites" id="secWeb">
        <h3>HTML & Websites</h3>
        <p>I know a bit about HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc and have made a few websites.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I wrote <a onclick="alert('You are already at heliomug.com')" href="#secWeb">this website</a> from scratch.  </li>
          <li>I made a <a href="./caller/description.html">Random Student Caller</a> that allows students to call on random students and track their responses. </li> 
          <li>I wrote this web version of <a href="./prog/web/fckc">Face Card, Kill Card</a>, a card game that my friends and I made up.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section title="Articles" id="secArticles">
        <h3>Articles, Etc</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="./docs/resume/craig_weidert-resume.pdf">My Resume</a></li>
          <li><a href="./docs/articles/face_card_kill_card.pdf">Instructions</a> for the "Face Card / Kill Card" game that some friends and I made up. </li>
          <li><a href="./docs/articles/skid_patches_and_fixies.pdf">An article</a> relating skid patches and simplified fractions.</li>
          <li><a href="./docs/articles/weidert_-_extremal_problems_in_ordered_graphs.pdf">My master's thesis</a> about how many edges an ordered bipartite graph can contain before it must contain a paritcular subgraph.  Alternately, it's about how many zeros you can cram into a zero-one matrix before that matrix must contain a particular different matrix as a submatrix.  </li>
          <li><a href="./docs/articles/ICC09.pdf">A paper</a> summarizing some research I did with a few other students during the 2006 Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Harvey Mudd College.  It describes some approximation algorithms / heuristics for routing traffic requests through a sub-network with a single source node and multiple bands / wavelengths along which the traffic can be sent.  It's like a weird case of bin packing.  </li>
        </ul>
