        <h2>My Machine Learning Experience</h2>

        <p>
          I don't have a tons and tons of experience with machine learning problems, but I know a bit.  When I was at Harvey Mudd College, I took a neural networks class, though this was in 2006 before any sort of deep-learning revolution.  I've also taken <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Andrew Ng's Excellent Coursera Machine Learning Class</a>, which features a number of problems and algorithms written in Octave (like Matlab).  I've also read through <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning">Sebastian Raschka's book, "Python Machine Learning"</a> and looked through a fair number of machine learning websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, I have some familiarity with the Python packages pandas, numpy, scikit, and matplotlib.  I have a good understanding of various machine learning concepts, including variance vs bias, supervised vs unsupervised learning, k-fold cross validation, etc, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've applied many kinds of models and techniques, including linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, k-means, random forest, neural net, and PCA.  Besides toy assignments from books or classes, I've worked through a couple of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">the competitions on kaggle.com</a>.
