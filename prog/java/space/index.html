        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I was working on this <a href="./space.jar">space / tank game</a>
          during late January / early February 2017.  If you're feeling
          agressive, you can try to shoot each other, but it's oftentimes just
          as fun to just fly around the screen.  You'll need the <a
          href="https://www.google.com/search?q=java%20jre%20download">Java JRE
          version 8+</a> to get it to run.  The source code is available at <a
          href="http://github.com/cweidert/space_skirmish">github.com</a>.

        <h3>Motivation</h3>

        <p>
            The main reason I wanted to work on this project was so that I
            could try out some networking.  I had made a couple of pretty
            similar games in the past, but hadn't ever gotten two computers to
            talk to each other in any meaningful way.

                In one mode of the game, you can fly around as a spaceship.  If
                the planet and gravity are enabled, then it's fun to try to put
                your ship in and out of orbit.  Or it's also fun to try to use
                your ship's gravity to tug the other ships around the screen.
                In any case, I feel that if you play you'll learn a lot about
                inertia.

                In the other mode of the game, you can play as a tank driving
                around the screen.  In pratical terms, this means that there is
                no inertia, no gravitational attraction, and the ships are
                rendered differently.

                If you play where all the players have the same exact key
                assignments it can be kind of fun because you can make the
                ships to pretty intricate "synchronized swimming" routines.

                If you enable the "safe zone" option and your ship / tank
                leaves the safe zone, then your ship / tank will only survive
                for a little while.

                The landing screen lets you select basic parameters about the
                game you'd like to play.  After you hit "Play!", you are taken

                The players screen lets you edit the players for the game.  You
                can change the buttons for each player or add new players with
                different colors and names.  If you are running a game over the
                internet, you can boot out external players too.

                can put a lifespan on the bullets, edit the "safe zone"
                settings (see below), tweak gravity settings, make the screen
                wrap-around, and a few other things.  I'd like to add more
                options to this screen in the future.

                Using the internet screen, you can host a game on the internet
                so that other people can join.  In order to see other games in
                the world at large, I must be running my server to host game
                lists at my house.  However, you should always be able to see
                games in your lan.  And in the worst case, you can type in your
                friend's ip address and port number manually.  I order to host
                a game, you must open up a port on your router so that
                connections can find their way to your computer.  This is a
                disadvantage.

        <h3>Tools</h3>

        <p>
            The main new tool that I used was sockets.  It was a little bit
            tricky because I needed the connection to be two-way.  The way the
            process works when you are playing online, there is one master
            computer that hosts the game.  That computer handles all the
            physics, collisions, etc of the game and send updated versions of
            the game out to any connected computers, which should be listening
            for updates.  Those connected computers can also send requests like
            "turn the booster off for the ship of player 2".  The master
            computer listens for these requests and implements them as they
            come in.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I also used a lot of things I usually use for these kinds of
          projects: Swing, threads, functional interfaces, lambda expressions,
          graphics, etc etc.

        <h3>Future Work / Improvements</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Gameplay suffers massively when the two computers playing the same
            game online are far apart / have latency issues.  A way I could fix
            this is by having each computer be in charge of its local players'
            own positions and reporting those positions back to the master
            computer, rather than having the computers send requests to move
            back to the master computer.  This should be fairly feasible, but I
            don't have time to fix it right now.  
          </li>
          <li>
            The user interface is still somewhat janky and if I had unlimited
            time, I'd like to clean it up somewhat.  
          </li>
          <li>
            I'd like to make a point-of-view mode where you are playing from an
            individual ship's point of view.

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>

        <p>
          This game was pretty fun to write and I'm fairly satisfied with how
          it turned out.  Though I was motivated to start it mainly to work on
          sockets / internet connections, I did actually spend most of my time
          writing code that had nothing to do with that.  Nonetheless, I did
          learn about some socket / internet stuff and am glad I worked on this
          project.
