        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          This is a project I was working on in November 2016.  It's to visualize readings from individual genomes.  The idea is that each reading has a start point, an end point, and a value, which indicates the strength of a match between the start and end point.  I was tasked with structuring the data in such a way that a user could perform fast queries on the data and display the results.  A typical query might be something like "I want to select all the readings between chromosome 1 offset 1,000,000 and chromosome 2 offset 500,000."  
        </p>
        <p>
          This program was only ever run on a toy dataset with approximately 2.9 million readings.  In real life the dataset would be much larger.  I was explicitly forbidden from using databases.

              This tab displays measures about the results as a graph.  You can pick which measures for the data you want to display (start, end, length, value) and how to display them (on the x-axis, on the y-axis, or via color).  The picture may be saved to file.

              This tab displays statistics for one measure of the results.  Summary statistics are shown and a histogram is displayed for whichever measure for the results you select (start, end, length, value).  This histogram and the accompanying summary statistics may be saved to file.

        <h3>Programming Concepts Used</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I used lambda selections to extract the various measures from the readings in the results.  
          </li>
          <li> 
            I used Java's Swing package to make the GUI.  
          </li>
          <li>
            Because I was forbidden from using any kind of database, I wrote a B-Tree to store the data in some sorted form.  I somewhat arbitrarily chose each node to have a maximum of 1,024 readings.  Each node would be saved to the disk for quick future loading.  
          </li>
          <li>
            I used threads to read the data file and build the tree structure.  
          </li>
          <li>
            I used enums, regular expressions, interval trees, interfaces, abstract classes, polymorphism, affine transforms, singletons, factory classes, and functional interfaces.  
          </li>
        </ul>
