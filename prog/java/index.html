        <p>
          Here are a few Java projects that I've made.  Most of them are available as *.jar files.  You'll need the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java JRE</a> to get them to run.

                This is a <a href="./traffic/traffic.jar">traffic simulator program</a>.  There are little circular cars that pick a random destination, decide how to get there, and try to navigate through the map without hitting any other cars.  If there are too many cars, sometimes they get in a traffic jam.  The program is a little silly, but it's fun to watch.  
              </p>
              <p>
                The program makes use of:
                <ul>
                  <li>QuadTrees for collision detection / collision avoidance.</li>
                  <li>Threading to run each vehicle and each stop light</li>
                  <li>Graph algorithms for for vehicles to figure out how to get to their goals.</li>
                </ul>

                This is <a href="./rpncalc/heliomug_calculator.jar">my Reverse Polish Notation Calculator</a>.  If you don't know about it already, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish Notation</a> is great!  It lets you work quickly and is convenient for saving previous calculations and quantities for later use.  I was having trouble finding a nice implementation on one that included macros, so I decided to make one myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                It works pretty well, but it helps if you have a number pad on your computer.  It's also got macro recording capability, which is great if you have common sequences of keypresses.  For your (my) convenience, this program is also available as an <a href="./rpncalc/heliomug_rpn_calculator.exe">*.exe</a> file for folks on Windows.

              This <a href="./demos/KeyboardDisplay.jar">keyboard display</a> is something I made to help my students learn how to type.  It turns out that if you can't type without looking at the keyboard, you'll make very slow progress.  Lots of my students will type a bit, make a mistake, delete a bit, try to retype what they were going for in the first place, make another mistake, etc.  The idea behind this display is that it'll stay on the screen so the students can practice not looking at their hands when they type.  It stays on top of all the windows too.
