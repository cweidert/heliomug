          Here are a few Java projects that I've made.  Most of them are available as *.jar files.  You'll need the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java JRE</a> to get them to run.

              <a href="./music/trainer/ear_trainer.jar">An ear trainer program</a>.  This is a program to help you with ear training.  The first tab is to help you identify different kinds of chords, the second tab is to help you identify chords in a given key, and the third tab is to help you identify intervals between two notes.  Here's a slightly more thorough <a href="./music/trainer/index.html">description</a> of the program.

              The program makes use of:
              <ul>
                <li>Lots of functional interfaces and lambda expressions.  </li>
                <li>Midi music. </li>

              <a href="./traffic/traffic.jar">A Traffic simulator program</a>.  There are little circular cars that pick a random destination, decide how to get there, and try to navigate through the map without hitting any other cars.  If there are too many cars, sometimes they get in a traffic jam.  The program is a little silly, but it's fun to watch.

                <a href="./rpncalc/heliomug_calculator.jar">My Reverse Polish Notation Calculator</a>.  If you don't know about it already, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish Notation</a> is great!  It lets you work quickly and is convenient for saving previous calculations and quantities for later use.  I was having trouble finding a nice implementation on one that included macros, so I decided to make one myself.
              </p>
              <p>
                It works pretty well, but it helps if you have a number pad on your computer.  It's also got macro recording capability, which is great if you have common sequences of keypresses.  For your (my) convenience, this program is also available as an <a href="./rpncalc/heliomug_rpn_calculator.exe">*.exe</a> file for folks on Windows.

              I wrote this <a href="./biod/">Genome Query Displayer</a> to read a large data file full of readings and display the results of queries on those readings.  Each reading consisted of a chromosome, start offset, end offset, and value.  My program read the raw text files with data, structured the data so that it was easy to run fast queries, then displayed the results of those queries in various ways.  I was explicitly forbidden from using databases.

              The program makes use of:

                <li>B-Trees to store large amounts of readings.</li>
                <li>Lambda expressions (new in Java 8) to extract features from readings.</li>
                <li>Swing for the GUI</li>
                <li>Threads to load and process the data more quickly</li>
                <li>Regular Expressions for file parsing</li>
                <li>Abstract classes, interfaces, polymorphism, factory classes, singletons, enums, file input/output</li>

It turns out that if you can't type without looking at the keyboard, you'll make very slow progress.  Lots of my students will type a bit, make a mistake, delete a bit, try to retype what they were going for in the first place, make another mistake, etc.  The idea behind this display is that it'll stay on the screen so the students can practice not looking at their hands when they type.  It stays on top of all the windows too.
