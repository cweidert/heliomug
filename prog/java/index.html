        <h1>Java Projects</h1>
        <p>
          Here are a few Java projects that I've made.  Most of them are available as *.jar files.  You'll need the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java JRE</a> to get them to run.

        <h2>Traffic Simulator</h2>
        <a href="./traffic/traffic.jar"><img class="cenImg" src="./images/traffic.png" width=640 height=834 alt="Traffic Simulator Screenshot"></a>

        <p>
          This is a traffic simulator program.  It uses:
          <ul>
            <li>QuadTrees for collision detection.</li>
            <li>Threading to run each vehicle</li>
            <li>Graph algorithms for for vehicles to figure out how to get to their goals.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Reverse Polish Notation Calculator</h2>
        <a href="./rpncalc/heliomug_calculator.jar"><img class="cenImg" src="./images/rpncalc.png" width=432 height=433 alt="Heliomug Calculator Screenshot"></a>

        <p>
          I couldn't find a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">reverse polish notation</a> calculator, so I decided to make one.  It works pretty well, but it helps if you have a number pad on your computer.  It's also got macro recording capability, which is great if you have common sequences of keypresses.  For your (my) convenience, this program is also available as an <a href="./rpncalc/heliomug_rpn_calculator.exe">*.exe</a> file for folks on Windows.

        <h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
        <a href="./gameoflife/GameOfLife.jar"><img class="cenImg" src="./images/gameoflife.png" width=640 height=259 alt="Game of Life Screenshot"></a>

        <p>
          This is a program to run a simulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>.  It's super interesting.  You can save and load boards and so on.

        <h2>Drum Machine</h2>
        <a href="./drummachine/DrumMachine.jar"><img class="cenImg" src="./images/drummachine.png" width=640 height=279 alt="Drum Machine Screenshot"></a>

        <p>
          Here's a little drum machine that plays through midi.  You can save an load loops, but I really need to add the ability to sequence loops together to make a song.

      <section title="Keyboard Display" id="secKeyboard">
        <h2>Keyboard Displayer</h2>
        <a href="./demos/KeyboardDisplay.jar"><img class="cenImg" src="./images/keyboard.png" width=545 height=168 alt="Keyboard Displayer Screenshot"></a>

        <p>
          This is something I made to help my students learn how to type.  It turns out that if you can't type without looking at the keyboard, you'll make very slow progress.  Lots of my students will type a bit, make a mistake, delete a bit, try to retype what they were going for in the first place, make another mistake, etc.  The idea behind this display is that it'll stay on the screen so the students can practice not looking at their hands when they type.  It stays on top of all the windows too.

      <section title="Color Demo" id="secColors">
        <h2>Color Demo</h2>
        <a href="./demos/colorHexDemo.jar"><img class="cenImg" src="./images/colors.png" width=640 height=243 alt="Color Demo Screenshot"></a>

        <p>
          This is just a little program to show how red, green, and blue mix to make colors on monitors, tv, the web, etc.

      <section title="Number Bases" id="secNumberBases">
        <h2>Number Base Demo</h2>
        <a href="./demos/NumberBaseDemo.jar"><img class="cenImg" src="./images/bases.png" width=600 height=328 alt="Number Base Demo Screenshot"></a>

        <p>
          This is something I made to help my students learn about different number bases.  Thinking more about, maybe I should show the numbers as graduated cylinders or something where the capacity is the base and the level is the digit.
