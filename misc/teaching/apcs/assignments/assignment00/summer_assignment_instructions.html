	<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Welcome to AP Computer Science.  So that we can get a running start on the year, there are a few things I want you to work on over the summer.  Please read through and follow all the directions below.  
</p>

<p>
Your assignment has three parts:
<ol>
	<li><a href="#part 1">Send me an e-mail introducing yourself.</a></li>
	<li><a href="#part 2">Install Eclipse and run your first program.</a></li>
	<li><a href="#part 3">Learn how to convert between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal numbers.</a></li>
	<li><a href="#part 4">Learn how computers store and display colors.</a></li>
</ol>
You will also need a flash drive for the class, so keep on the look out for one of those.  
</p>

<p>
Part 1 is due on June 15th, part 2 is due on June 27, and part 3 is due when school starts.  You will have a quiz worth one billion points on the first day of school.  
</p>

<p>
I will be calling home to people I do not hear from in the next week or so.  If you do not have a computer at home that you can use to work on, please e-mail me as soon as possible.  
</p>

<p>
Knowing how to work with different number bases is useful for computer science.  Howver, parts 3 and 4 exist primarily to convice me that you are capable of working independently and that you are at least somewhat ready for this class.  
</p>

<p>
Best, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mr. Weidert
</p>

<section title="Send me an e-mail">
<a name="part 1"/>
<h2>Part 1: Introduce yourself via e-mail (Due 6/15)</h2>
<p>
This part of the summer assignment is very easy.  Send Mr. Weidert and e-mail with the following information:  
<ul>
<li>Your name </li>
<li>Why you are interested in computer science</li>
<li>Your math teacher & class this past year (2014-2015)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Make sure you send your e-mail from a professional, school-appropriate address.  If you do not have such an address, get one now and start checking it regularly.  I strongly recommend using Gmail.  
</p>

<section title="Getting Started">
<h2>Part 2: Getting started with Java & Eclipse (Due 6/27)</h2>
<h3>Installing Java and Eclipse</h3>

<p>
There are lots of programming languages to choose from, but in this class we'll be using the Java programming language.  It's what the AP test will be based on and it seems like a pretty reasonable choice to me.  The first thing you'll have to do is download the SDK (software development kit) so that your computer has what it needs to make Java programs.  You should download the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">SDK</a>.  
</p>

<p>
If you have an Apple computer, pick and install the Mac OS X release.  If you have a Windows computer, first you need to figure out if you're running a 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) system.  You can do this by going to the control panel, clicking on "System", and looking at the "System type" entry.  If you are running an older (Windows XP) system, you have a 32-bit system.  If you have questions, please e-mail me.  
</p>

<p>
Next, download and install <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>.  Just like Microsoft Word is a program you use to write documents and Audacity is a program you can use to make and edit sound files, Eclipse is a program that we'll use to write computer programs.  These kinds of programs are called IDEs (integrated development environments).  You want the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers".  
</p>

<p>
You can run <a href="../../../prog/HelloThere.jar">this Demo</a> to see if your Java installation worked.  
</p>

<h3>Your first program</h3>

<p>
After you install Eclipse, open it up and pick wherever you want to have your workspace.  This is where all your code and programs will live on your computer.  It doesn't matter to me where you put it, but make sure you remember where it is.  
</p>

<p>
Go to File-->New-->Java Project and name your project something like "My First Project".  
</p>

<p>
Right click your new project and tell it that you want a new Java class.  Under "name", put "MyFirstClass" exactly.  Notice that it's one long word and that the "M", "F", and "C" are capitalized.  Hit "Finish".  Eclipse should give you a file that looks like this:  
</p>

<p><code><pre>
public class MyFirstClass {

}
</pre></code></p>

<p>
You need to edit the file so that it looks like this:  
</p>

<p><code><pre>
public class MyFirstClass { 
	public static void main(String [] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, my name is _____");
	}
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>
Make sure you are extra careful to avoid typos.  Please include the tabs in your code.  Fill in the blank with your own full, legal name so I can tell who made it.  
</p>

<p>
I know almost all of those words seem totally foreign to you right now, but that's okay.  As we go through the year, we will learn what every single one of them means.  For now, we're just going to regard them as magic.  
</p>

<p>
Run the program by going to Run-->Run.  You can also click the green arrow.  On the bottom it should print out your message.  
</p>

<p>
Congratulations!  There's your first program.  Please pat yourself on the back.  Please also take a selfie with a thumbs up in front of the computer's message and send it to me in an e-mail.  If you don't have a phone, just send me a screenshot.  
</p>

	<section title="Number Bases">
		<h2>Part 3: Number Bases (Due on the first day of school)</h2>
		
		If you want to jump in and try to figure binary (base 2) and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers on your own, you can use the <a href="../../../prog/NumberBaseDemo.jar">Number Base Demo</a> I made for you.  You can also try to figure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary numbers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal numbers</a> via Wikipedia or read the explanations I wrote below.  
		
		<h3>Decimal Numbers</h3>
		<p>
		More likely than not, the way that you have counted since you were a little kid is using decimal (base 10) numbers.  If you have a little kid to count to ten, they will do so on their fingers.  For that reason, with our traditional base 10 number system we have ten digits to choose from: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Counting from zero to nine, whenever we increment (add one to) a number, we simply go to the next digit.  (For instance, from 2 to 3 or from 7 to 8).  However, once we want to increment from the digit nine, we run out of digits.  We then go from the ones place (the digit all the way on the right) to the tens place (the next digit over).  The digit in the tens place is of course worth ten times as much as the digit in the ones place.  For instance, <blockquote>37 = 3 * 10 + 7 * 1 = 37.</blockquote>  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		We can of course go on to the hundreds place, the thousands place, etc.  Each place counting from the right is worth a higher and higher power of ten.  For instance, 
	
		<blockquote>
		<table>
		<tr>
		<td>2015</td>
		<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
		<td>2 * 10<sup>3</sup> + 0 * 10<sup>2</sup> + 1 * 10<sup>1</sup> + 5 * 10<sup>0</sup>.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td />
		<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
		<td>2 * 1000 + 0 * 100 + 1 * 10 + 5 * 1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td />
		<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
		<td>2000 + 10 + 5</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td />
		<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
		<td>2015</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		</blockquote>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In general, the nth place (counting from the right starting with zero) is worth 10<sup>n</sup>.  For instance, place number three (<u>2</u>015) is worth 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000.  
		</p>
		
		<h3>Binary Numbers</h3>
		<p>
		Most computers do not have ten fingers.  Thus, they have no particular affinity for the base-ten system.  What computers do have is electricity and magnetism.  On a hard disk, a spot on the disk either magnetized North-South or South-North.  On a wire, you can either have a high voltage or a low voltage.  For a computer, all digits are either "high" or "low", "on" or "off", etc.  These digits have only two options and are known as "binary digits" or "bits" for short.  Whereas we have the ten digits from 0 to 9 to write numbers in a base ten ("decimal") number system, computers only have the two digits 0 and 1 to write numbers in a base two ("binary") system.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		In a decimal (base 10) number system, each place was worth a power of ten.  In a binary (base 2) number system, each place is worth a power of two.  For instance, 
		<blockquote>
		<table>
		<tr>
		<td>100101<sub>2</sub></td>
		<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
		<td>1 * 2<sup>5</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>4</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>3</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>2</sup>+ 1 * 2<sup>1</sup>+ 1 * 2<sup>0</sup></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td />
		<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
		<td>1 * 32 + 0 * 16 + 0 * 8 + 1 * 4 + 0 * 2 + 1 * 2</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td />
		<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
		<td>32 + 4 + 1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td />
		<td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td>
		<td>37</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
		</blockquote>
		</p>		
		
		<p>
		Notice that there is a little two in the subscript of 100101<sub><u>2</u></sub>.  This is to denote that we're using the binary (base 2) number system.  
		</p>
		
		<h3>Hexadecimal Numbers</h3>
		<p>
		As you can imagine, it quickly becomes cumbersome to represent a number with any size using binary.  It takes over three times as many digits to represent a number in binary than it does in decimal.  However, people sometimes want a way to represent numbers.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		What computer programmers sometimes use instead of binary or decimal numbers is called "hexadecimal" numbers.  Instead of using base 2 or base 10, hexadecimal numbers use base 16.  Each single digit represents a value from 0 to 15.  Because we don't already have a single digit to represent the values from 10 to 15, we resort to using the letters A through F.  So, there are sixteen possible digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.  A counts as ten, B counts as eleven, ..., and F counts as fifteen.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The choice of base 16 is convenient for representing bits because one digit of a number written in hexadecimal exactly corresponds to four bits in binary.  This is because if you use four bits in binary, you can represent all the numbers from zero to fifteen. 
		<blockquote>
		<table>
		<tr><td>0<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>0000<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>0<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>1<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>0001<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>1<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>2<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>0010<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>2<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>3<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>0011<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>3<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>4<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>0100<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>4<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>5<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>0101<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>5<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>6<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>0110<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>6<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>7<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>0111<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>7<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>8<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>1000<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>8<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>9<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>1001<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>9<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>10<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>1010<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>A<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>11<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>1011<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>B<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>12<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>1100<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>C<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>13<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>1101<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>D<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>14<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>1110<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>E<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		<tr><td>15<sub>10</sub></td> <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td> <td>1111<sub>2</sub></td><td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;</td><td>F<sub>16</sub></td></tr>
		</table></blockquote>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Converting between hexadecimal and binary numbers is relatively easy because four bits corresponds to one hexadecimal digit.  So for instance, 
		<blockquote>
		37<sub>10</sub> = 100101<sub>2</sub> =  <font color="red">0010</font>&nbsp;<font color="blue">0101</font><sub>2</sub> = <font color="red">2</font><font color="blue">5</font><sub>16</sub>
		</blockquote>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		For historical reasons, rather than using a 16 in the subscript to signifiy a number in a hexidecimal base, programmers sometimes prepend the number with "0x".  So for instance, 0x25 = 25<sub>16</sub> = 37<sub>10</sub>.  People occasionally use "0b" to signify binary numbers too, but this is less common.  For example, 0b100101 = 100101<sub>2</sub> = 37<sub>10</sub>.  For other ways to write these numbers, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal#Written_representation">this page</a>.

		<h3>Your mission</h3>
		<p>
		Please see the Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary numbers page</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal numbers page</a> for additional information about number systems.  By the first day of school, you will be expected to be able to convert back and forth between these different number systems.  For instance, I might ask you how to write 37 in binary (100101<sub>2</sub>) or hexadecimal (0x25).  Do you not have to know how to perform arithmetic on binary or hexadecimal numbers.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		You are also responsible for knowing the powers of two up to 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		I made a <a href="../../../prog/NumberBaseDemo.jar">Number Base Demo</a> for you.  You can use it both to explore numbers in different bases and to get ready for your quiz by picking the "Hide Base Ten" option and practicing conversions.  I have included some additional background information below.

	<section title="Computer Colors">
		<h2>Part 4: Colors (Due on the first day of school)</h2>
		<p>
		To display images, computer screens, televisions, cell phones, and other electronic displays use a grid of pixels, which can be thought of as tiny rectangles on the screen.  A typical computer or phone screen might be something like 1280 pixels across in one direction and 720 pixels in the other direction.  Each of these pixels displays one of the thousands or millions of colors that a human can distinguish and thus an entire image is displayed.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		To produce these colors, electronic displays take advantage of a special fact about humans' eyes.  Human eyes have different kinds of cells for different kinds of vision.  They have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell">cones</a> to detect color and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_cell">rods</a> that are more sensitive to dim light.  There are three types of cone cells.  One detects primarily red light, one detects primarily green light, and one detects primarily blue light.  To see a color, your brain interprets a mixture of inputs from these three types of cone cells.  For instance, if you see a purple object, the light from that object is likely primarily activating red and blue cones in your eye.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Electronic displays use your ability to see colors as mixtures of red, green, and blue when displaying colors.  Each pixel on these types of displays has three components: red, green, and blue.  (In fact, if you look very closely at a white image on an old TV or computer monitor, you can see these colors individually.)  The way that electronic screens store, transmit, and display colors is by keeping track of the red level, green level, and blue level of a color for each pixel.  For instance, to display a pixel with a color of bright purple, a screen might turn the red value of a pixel all the way up and the blue value of the pixel all the way up.  

		</p>
		
		<p>
		These levels typically run from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 255.  If you have done your homework, you might realize that these are special numbers in binary and hexadecimal (0<sub>10</sub> = 0<sub>2</sub> = 0x0) and (255<sub>10</sub> = 11111111<sub>2</sub> = 0xFF).  Conveniently, it takes exactly 8 bits or two hexidecimal digits to represent all possible values of a single color.  Of course, the people who designed this system chose these limits for exactly that reason.  
		</p>
		
		<h3>Your Mission</h3>
		<p>
		Please play around with this <a href="../../../prog/colorHexDemo.jar">Color Demo</a> program so that you get a feel for what mixtures of components and values make what colors.  In particular, for your quiz when school starts, you should be able to give reasonable hex codes for red, blue, green, gray, white, black, yellow, purple, orange, and brown.  (For instance, to get a nice rich purple you could use 0x800080.)  You should also have a rough idea what color a given hex code will give you.  (For instance, 0x800000 will give you a nice dark red / maroon.)  You can read the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors">web colors page</a> for more information.
